__PyFlux__ is an open source time series library for Python. The library has a good array of modern time series models, as well as a flexible array of inference options (frequentist and Bayesian) that can be applied to these models. By combining breadth of models with breadth of inference, PyFlux allows for a probabilistic approach to time series modelling.

See some examples and documentation below. PyFlux is still only alpha software; this means you use it at your own risk, that test coverage is still in need of expansion, and also that some modules are still in need of being optimized.

**Note From Author** : I am currently working on other projects as of now, so have paused updates for this library for the immediate future. If you'd like to help move the library forward by contributing, then do get in touch! I am planning to review at end of year and update the library as required (new version requirements, etc).

## Installing PyFlux

```{bash}
pip install pyflux
```

## Python Version

Supported on Python 2.7 and 3.5.

## Run tests

1. install development requirements: `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
2. compile cython modules: `python setup.py build_ext --inplace` (takes some time)
3. run tests: `py.test -s --pyargs pyflux`

## Talks

- [PyData San Francisco 2016](https://github.com/RJT1990/PyData2016-SanFrancisco) - August 2016 -  a tour of time series (and predicting NFL games)
- [PyData London Meetup](https://github.com/RJT1990/talks/blob/master/PyDataTimeSeriesTalk.ipynb) - June 2016 - an introduction to the library in its early stages
